# 60Hz-Digital-Notch-Filter

The program removes the 60Hz range of an incoming signal using a digital notch filter. Filtering the signal begins when the sinusoid enters the ADC module in the MSP432 to be 
filtered with the help of a notch filter transfer function included in the code,and concludes when it exits through an external DAC after being filtered.
